I have to say that the Spring of Beijing is coming, I only wear a T-shirt these days without feeling any kinds of cold. In fact I am pretty busy these days, as for the course work and the internship I'm taking. Oh yes, I have to continue fighting wiht GRE. 

In the morning I get up at around 7 am and have breakfast in the canteen in my university, usually it only takes me 5 RMB yuan to have a very content food. I think it is really cheap even compare to those resturaunts outside the campus. And I still remember the breakfast in Japan, which commonly around 1000 en approximately 59 yuan in China. That is definitely a great expense for me.
